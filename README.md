# Tailwind + React Project

This project was created to learn Tailwind CSS while building a React application. I followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/tS7upsfuxmo?si=MriOLlnDlTbM96gF) but also implemented custom features to make it my own.

Since this was also one of my first React projects, it served as a learning experience for both React and Tailwind.

## Technologies Used
- React  
- Tailwind CSS (version 4)

## Customizations
While following the tutorial, I made various modifications to explore Tailwind's customization options and experiment with different React components.  
Additionally, instead of using the older Tailwind version from the tutorial, I implemented Tailwind CSS version 4 to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.

## Lessons Learned
- How to structure a React project  
- Styling with Tailwind CSS  
- Customizing Tailwind classes  
- Basic component-based development in React  
- Differences between older Tailwind versions and Tailwind 4  

## Future Improvements
- Adding more interactivity  
- Exploring additional Tailwind plugins  
- Refining component structure
